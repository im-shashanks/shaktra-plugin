# Shaktra TDD — Testing & Coding Knowledge

This skill provides the knowledge base for writing tests and production code. It is loaded by agents during the TDD pipeline — it does not orchestrate any workflow.

## Boundary

**This skill defines:** HOW to write tests (practices, patterns, anti-patterns) and HOW to write production code (implementation patterns, security, observability, resilience).

**shaktra-quality defines:** HOW to evaluate code and tests (checks, review dimensions, gate logic).

**shaktra-reference defines:** WHAT severity levels mean (`severity-taxonomy.md`), WHAT quality principles apply (`quality-principles.md`), and WHAT the handoff state machine looks like (`schemas/handoff-schema.md`).

This skill never restates severity definitions, quality dimensions, or schema structures — it references them.

## Sub-Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `testing-practices.md` | 12 core testing principles — behavioral testing, TDD cycle, isolation, mocking, edge cases |
| `coding-practices.md` | Implementation patterns, error handling, security, observability, resilience essentials |
| `resilience-practices.md` | Retry with backoff+jitter, timeouts by operation type, circuit breaker, fallback hierarchy, failure mode table |
| `concurrency-practices.md` | Idempotency patterns (3 types), optimistic locking, atomic operations, concurrent test harness |

## How Agents Use This Skill

**sw-engineer** loads this skill to inform implementation and test planning:
- Reads `testing-practices.md` for test strategy guidance
- Reads `coding-practices.md` for pattern selection during plan creation

**test-agent** loads this skill to write behavioral tests:
- Follows `testing-practices.md` for test structure, naming, assertions
- References edge case strategy and mocking boundaries

**developer** loads this skill to write production code:
- Follows `coding-practices.md` for implementation patterns
- Applies security, observability, and resilience essentials
- References `resilience-practices.md` for retry, timeout, circuit breaker, and fallback patterns
- References `concurrency-practices.md` for idempotency, locking, and atomic operations
