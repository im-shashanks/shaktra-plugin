# TPM Workflow Templates

Step-by-step orchestration for each TPM sub-intent. The TPM SKILL.md classifies intent and routes to the appropriate workflow here.

## Quality Loop Pattern

Reusable pattern used by multiple workflows. Referenced as "run quality loop" below.

```
quality_loop(artifact_path, artifact_type, creator_agent, max_attempts=3):
  attempt = 0
  WHILE attempt < max_attempts:
    attempt += 1
    result = spawn tpm-quality(artifact_path, artifact_type)

    IF result == QUALITY_PASS:
      RETURN QUALITY_PASS

    IF result == QUALITY_BLOCKED:
      spawn creator_agent.fix(findings=result.findings)
      CONTINUE

  # Loop exhausted
  EMIT MAX_LOOPS_REACHED
  Present findings to user with:
    - all unresolved findings
    - number of fix attempts made
    - recommendation: manual review needed
  RETURN QUALITY_BLOCKED
```

## Workflow: Full

Complete TPM workflow — design through sprint planning. This is the default for new features.

### Phase 1 — Design

1. Read `.shaktra/settings.yml` for project context
2. Spawn **architect** with analysis path (if brownfield) — architect reads PRD and architecture from fixed paths `.shaktra/prd.md` and `.shaktra/architecture.md`
3. Handle architect response:
   - **If `GAPS_FOUND`:** Spawn **product-manager** (mode: gaps) with the gap questions
     - For each PM answer: if `PM_ESCALATE`, ask user via AskUserQuestion
     - Re-spawn **architect** with gap answers
     - Repeat until no gaps remain (max 3 gap rounds)
   - **If design doc returned:** Continue to quality review
4. Run quality loop: `quality_loop(design_doc_path, "design", architect)`
5. If `QUALITY_PASS`: proceed to Phase 2
6. If `QUALITY_BLOCKED` after max loops: present to user, await resolution

### Phase 2 — Stories

1. Spawn **scrummaster** (mode: create) with the approved design doc
2. For each story produced: run quality loop `quality_loop(story_path, "story", scrummaster)`
3. If any story blocked after max loops: present blocked stories to user
4. Collect all passing stories for Phase 3

### Phase 3 — PM Analysis

1. Spawn **product-manager** (mode: coverage) with stories directory — PM reads PRD from `.shaktra/prd.md`
   - If coverage < 100%: present gap report to user
   - User decides: create additional stories or accept gaps
   - If additional stories needed: return to Phase 2 for the new stories
2. Spawn **product-manager** (mode: rice) with stories directory
   - Stories classified as Quick Wins, Big Bets, Standard
   - Sprint allocation written to `.shaktra/sprints.yml` (if sprints enabled)

### Phase 4 — Memory

1. Spawn **memory-curator** with workflow_type: "tpm-planning", artifacts_path: stories directory
2. This step is mandatory — every full workflow ends with memory capture

### Completion

Present summary to user:
- Design doc path
- Stories created (count, total points)
- Quality review results
- Coverage report (% and any gaps)
- Quick Wins and Big Bets identified
- Sprint allocation (if enabled)
- Unresolved items (if any)

---

## Workflow: Design Only

Create a design doc without proceeding to stories.

1. Execute Full Workflow Phase 1 (Design)
2. Execute Full Workflow Phase 4 (Memory)
3. Present design doc path and quality results

---

## Workflow: Stories Only

Create stories from an existing design doc. Requires an approved design doc.

**Prerequisite:** Design doc must exist at `.shaktra/designs/`. If not found, inform user and recommend running the design workflow first.

1. Locate the design doc (user-specified path or search `.shaktra/designs/`)
2. Execute Full Workflow Phase 2 (Stories)
3. Execute Full Workflow Phase 3 (PM Analysis)
4. Execute Full Workflow Phase 4 (Memory)
5. Present stories summary, coverage, and sprint allocation

---

## Workflow: Enrich

Enrich existing sparse stories with tier-appropriate detail.

1. Locate story files to enrich (user-specified paths or search `.shaktra/stories/`)
2. Read `.shaktra/settings.yml` for project context
3. Spawn **scrummaster** (mode: enrich) with story paths
   - Single story: one spawn
   - Batch (multiple stories): scrummaster processes sequentially with batch Final Verification
4. Run quality loop for each enriched story: `quality_loop(story_path, "story", scrummaster)`
5. Present enriched stories to user for approval before writing
6. On user approval: write final versions to `.shaktra/stories/`
7. Spawn **memory-curator** with workflow_type: "story-enrichment"

---

## Workflow: Hotfix

Fast path for trivial fixes. Produces a Trivial-tier story with minimal overhead.

1. Read `.shaktra/settings.yml` for project context
2. Spawn **scrummaster** (mode: create) with user's hotfix description
   - Scrummaster creates a single Trivial-tier story (3 fields: id, title, description)
3. Single quality pass — spawn **tpm-quality** once (no loop, no retry)
   - If `QUALITY_PASS`: present to user for confirmation
   - If `QUALITY_BLOCKED`: present findings to user (hotfixes shouldn't fail quality, but if they do, user decides)
4. On user confirmation: write story to `.shaktra/stories/`
5. Recommend next step: `/shaktra:dev` to implement the hotfix

---

## Workflow: Sprint

Re-prioritize and allocate stories to sprints without creating new stories.

**Prerequisite:** Stories must exist in `.shaktra/stories/`. If none found, inform user.

1. Spawn **product-manager** (mode: rice) with stories directory
2. Scrummaster allocates stories to sprints based on RICE classification and velocity
3. Present sprint plan:
   - Current sprint stories with points
   - Quick Wins highlighted for early execution
   - Big Bets with scheduling recommendations
   - Backlog with priority ordering
4. Spawn **memory-curator** with workflow_type: "sprint-planning"

---

## Error Handling

### Agent Failure

If a spawned agent fails (crashes, produces no output, or returns malformed output):
1. Retry the same agent spawn once
2. If retry fails: inform user with the error context, do not proceed with the workflow

### Missing Prerequisites

If a workflow requires artifacts that don't exist (e.g., stories workflow without a design doc):
1. Check for the artifact in the expected location
2. If not found: inform user what's missing and which workflow to run first
3. Do not attempt to create prerequisites automatically — each workflow has its scope

### Mid-Workflow Cancellation

If the user cancels mid-workflow:
1. Any artifacts already written to disk remain (they're valid intermediate state)
2. Report what was completed and what remains
3. The user can resume by running the appropriate sub-workflow (e.g., stories-only after design-only)

### Missing Settings

If `.shaktra/settings.yml` doesn't exist:
1. Inform user to run `/shaktra:init` first
2. Do not proceed — settings are required for tier detection and threshold evaluation
