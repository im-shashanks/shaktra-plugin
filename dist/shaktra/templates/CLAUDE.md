## Contributing

### Before You Start

- Familiarize yourself with the architecture (above)
- Read the quality standards (above)
- Review the decision log
- Check for existing issues/PRs

### Process

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Implement with TDD (tests → code)
3. Submit PR with:
   - Description of what/why
   - Link to relevant issue
   - Evidence of testing
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge when approved

### Getting Help

- **Framework questions:** See `.shaktra/CLAUDE.md`
- **Project questions:** Ask team members or check decision log
- **Technical questions:** Check this CLAUDE.md or raise an issue
