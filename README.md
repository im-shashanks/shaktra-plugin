# Claude Plugins

A curated collection of production-grade plugins for Claude Code.

## Shaktra -- AI Development Framework

What if Claude Code had a 12-person engineering team behind every command? Shaktra gives you an Architect, PM, QA, and 9 more specialized agents that enforce TDD, block bugs from merging, and scale ceremony to match complexity. Solo developers get team-level rigor; teams get consistency across every contributor.

### See it in action

Three commands take you from idea to production-ready, fully tested code:

```bash
# 1. Plan your feature
/shaktra:tpm "add OAuth 2.0 support to the API"
# -> Design doc, 8 stories generated, sprint planned

# 2. Implement with TDD enforcement
/shaktra:dev ST-001
# -> Tests written first, code passes, 36 quality checks, done

# 3. Review before merge
/shaktra:review ST-001
# -> 13-dimension analysis, P0 findings block merge automatically
```

### Highlights

- **12 specialized agents** -- Architect, PM, QA, Developer, Code Reviewer, and more
- **TDD state machine** -- tests before code, enforced at every transition
- **P0 findings blocked from merge** -- hooks, not warnings
- **70-95% coverage by story tier** -- hotfix ships fast, features ship thoroughly
- **Brownfield + greenfield** -- 9-dimension codebase analysis for existing projects
