# Shaktra — Claude Code Plugin

Shaktra is an opinionated software development framework distributed as a Claude Code plugin. It orchestrates specialized AI agents through agile-inspired workflows to produce industry-standard, reliable, production code.

## How We Work on This Project

This is a **collaborative build**. For every aspect of Shaktra:

1. **Reference Forge first** — Before building any component, review the corresponding Forge implementation at `~/workspace/applications/forge-claudify`. Understand what exists, what worked, what didn't.
2. **Discuss before implementing** — Present findings, propose the Shaktra approach, discuss tradeoffs. No implementation until we've aligned on the approach.
3. **Implement after agreement** — Only after discussion, build the component following the agreed design.
4. **Validate against constraints** — Check every deliverable against the design constraints below.

## Starting a Phase

When the user says "work on Phase X" or "let's start Phase X":

1. **Read** `docs/shaktra-plan/high-level.md` — architecture and philosophy context
2. **Read** `docs/shaktra-plan/architecture-overview.md` — plugin structure, components, constraints
3. **Read** `docs/shaktra-plan/phases/phase-XX-*.md` — the specific phase file
4. **Read each Forge file** listed in the phase's Forge Reference table (at `~/workspace/applications/forge-claudify`)
5. **Present** — what Forge does, what Shaktra should do differently, proposed approach
6. **Wait for approval** — no implementation until we've aligned
7. **Validate** — after implementation, check the phase's Validation list AND `docs/shaktra-plan/appendices.md` (Appendix A anti-patterns)

## Plugin Structure

This is a **Claude Code plugin** (NOT a regular project). The directory layout follows the plugin spec:

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json  # Marketplace catalog (source: "./dist") — stays at repo root
dist/                            # THE PLUGIN — all plugin code lives here
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json     # Plugin manifest (required)
  agents/                        # Sub-agent definitions
  skills/                        # Skill definitions
  hooks/hooks.json               # Hook configurations
  scripts/                       # Hook implementation scripts (Python)
  templates/                     # State file templates for /shaktra:init
docs/                            # Dev-only — architecture, phase plans, Forge analysis
Resources/                       # Dev-only — diagrams, reference docs
CLAUDE.md                        # Dev-only — this file (not installed)
```

**All plugin development happens in `dist/`.** Dev files (docs, Resources, CLAUDE.md) stay at repo root and are never installed.

Skills are namespaced as `/shaktra:skill-name` when installed by users.

**SKILL.md files require YAML frontmatter** with at least `name` and `description` fields for Claude Code to discover them.

For local dev testing: `claude --plugin-dir dist/`

## Key Design Decisions

These were explicitly chosen and must not be overridden:

- **Full persona descriptions** for all agents (detailed experience-based identity)
- **Full sprint planning** with velocity tracking and capacity planning
- **SW Quality and Code Reviewer are separate** — SW Quality checks story-level during TDD, Code Reviewer checks app-level after completion and reviews PRs
- **Quality depth must match or exceed Forge** — we reduce bloat, not capability
- **Plugin distribution** via `/plugin install shaktra` (marketplace.json at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
- **dist/ is the plugin** — Claude Code has no include/exclude mechanism for plugin installs, so all plugin code lives directly in `dist/`. Marketplace.json uses `"source": "./dist"` to scope what gets installed. Dev files (docs/, Resources/, CLAUDE.md) stay at repo root and are never shipped.
- **Future: separate distribution repo** — `marketplace add` clones the full repo (including dev files) into the user's marketplaces directory. Post-completion, split into a public distribution repo containing only `dist/` contents.

## Design Constraints

Check every file against these before considering any phase complete:

- No single file over 300 lines
- No content duplication across layers (skill defines, agent references — never both)
- No dead code, disabled stubs, or orphaned files
- Severity taxonomy (P0-P3) defined in exactly ONE file: `dist/skills/shaktra-reference/severity-taxonomy.md`
- All threshold values read from `.shaktra/settings.yml` — never hardcoded
- All hook scripts in Python (cross-platform, no `grep -oP`)
- Hooks block or don't exist — no warn-only
- No always-on rules consuming context every turn
- No ASCII art in agent/skill prompts
- No naming ambiguity between components

## Git Conventions

- **Never** include a `Co-Authored-By` line in commit messages
