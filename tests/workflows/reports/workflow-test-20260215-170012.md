[TEST:doctor] Starting smoke test...


I'll run all 10 diagnostic checks now. Let me start by gathering data in parallel.
Good. Now let me verify the SKILL.md files exist for all 15 expected skills. The glob returned no results for `*/SKILL.md` — let me check more carefully, since the SKILL.md files do appear in the broader glob.
Now let me validate the SKILL.md frontmatter and check sub-file references. Let me also verify Check 4 and Check 9.
Let me verify the orphaned files claim by checking if `prd-one-page.md` and `prd-standard.md` are referenced indirectly.
The templates are referenced by `prd-workflow.md` (a sub-file), not directly by `SKILL.md`. But Check 9 requires that every non-SKILL.md file be referenced by its parent skill's SKILL.md. Let me verify if SKILL.md references the templates directory or files.
The SKILL.md does not reference `templates/prd-one-page.md` or `templates/prd-standard.md`. These are orphaned per the check definition. Now let me also check `full-workflow-research.md` and `full-workflow-hypothesis.md` since those appeared in the glob.
Those are referenced. Now I have all the data. Let me also count the skills — I see 16 SKILL.md files but only 15 expected. The extra one is `shaktra-workflow`, which is in the expected list. Let me count: shaktra-analyze, shaktra-bugfix, shaktra-dev, shaktra-doctor, shaktra-general, shaktra-help, shaktra-init, shaktra-pm, shaktra-quality, shaktra-reference, shaktra-review, shaktra-status-dash, shaktra-stories, shaktra-tdd, shaktra-tpm, shaktra-workflow — that's 16, but the spec says 15. The spec lists 15 without shaktra-pm. Wait, let me recount the expected list: shaktra-analyze, shaktra-bugfix, shaktra-dev, shaktra-doctor, shaktra-general, shaktra-help, shaktra-init, shaktra-quality, shaktra-reference, shaktra-review, shaktra-status-dash, shaktra-stories, shaktra-tdd, shaktra-tpm, shaktra-workflow — 15. And `shaktra-pm` exists as an extra. All 15 expected are present, plus `shaktra-pm` as a bonus. That's fine — the check is that all 15 expected exist.

Now let me produce the report and log it.
