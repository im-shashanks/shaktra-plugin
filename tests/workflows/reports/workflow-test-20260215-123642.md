### tpm (FAIL)

```
[TEST:tpm] VERDICT: FAIL

**Result:** 69/70 checks passed. The single failure was:
- `decisions.yml` has no recorded decisions — the architect's gap analysis found no gaps (greenfield project with complete PRD), so the PM gap-answering step was never triggered, and no decisions were logged to `decisions.yml`.
```
